## auth module

Auth module presents the login for with yup validation;
MUI Grid is used for responsive design
Formik is used for form validation and submit
The global auth state is managed by React Context API

## remote module

Remote module has the button to decrease a number

## shell module(the host app)

Shell module is the main app who is using both auth module and remote module.
Shell module also has its own pages.

## Generate a remote module

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:remote remote-xxx host:shell` to generate a remote.

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace
